POLITICAL WORLD MAP FROM OSM DATA Shapefile QGIS stylesheets
==============================

This repo contains QGIS stylesheets (QML) for use with OpenStreetMap (OSM) Political Map data in ESRI Shapefile format. 

==============================

##Background

The political map of the world created from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) data using automated procedure which results with map in an intermediate stage. Necessary manual interventions for this map included final placement of the labels, attribute editing, and print layout design. Software, documentation and map data are published on GitHub under the name "OSMPoliticalMap".

##Info

The map is compiled at scale 1 : 30 000 000 in Winkel Tripel Projection, standard parallel 50Â°28', datum WGS84. 
It is designed for printing on A0 format. 
It shows independent states, dependencies or areas of special sovereignty as is in the OSM dataset, without adaptation to certain diplomatic recognition. 

We recommend this layer order:
- capitals_final
- oceans_final
- cities_final
- graticule
- admin_final
- coastlines_final
- lakes_final
- rivers_final
- countries_final
- frame_final
